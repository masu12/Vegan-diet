  <h1>Vegan diet</h1>
  <h2>Plant-base protein</h2>
  <p>There are many diferent foods that contein protein without having to eat meat. As we age, protein is important for keeping up muscle mass to stay active, avoid injury, and support a healthy immune system.

Choosing non-meat proteins in later years can be a good idea for more than just health or ethical reasons. “Many non-meat protein sources are lower in cost, and if you’re on a fixed income, then watching the food budget can be helpful,” says Angela Catic, MD, an assistant professor of internal medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.

Dental problems like missing teeth and dentures can come into play, too -- making a piece of steak or hamburger hard to chew. But there are plenty of ways to get protein besides meat. You just have to know what you’re looking for.</p>
  <b>Soy milk, almond milk, beans, tofu, nuts, whole grains </b>
  <i>non-animal protein</i>
